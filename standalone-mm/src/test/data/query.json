  "description": "A 4-meter diameter, 80-cm wide rotating debris flow flume was constructed at the University of California Richmond Field Station for studying large-scale granular flow phenomena. This dataset covers the experiments conducted in 2007 and 2008, where the primary goal was to study rates and mechanisms of bedrock erosion by debris flows.",
